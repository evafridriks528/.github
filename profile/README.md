Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate software developer with extensive experience in building scalable web applications and creating innovative solutions. My primary programming languages include JavaScript, Python, and Java. I have a strong background in both frontend and backend development, with a particular keen interest in React.js and Node.js.

Over the years, I've had the privilege to work on a variety of projects ranging from small startups to large-scale enterprise applications. My expertise lies in leveraging modern frameworks and libraries to enhance user experience while maintaining code quality and performance. I am well-versed in implementing RESTful APIs, working with databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and using version control systems like Git.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and follow best practices in software development, including Agile methodologies and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) principles. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and embrace new challenges, which keeps my skills fresh and relevant in this ever-evolving tech landscape.

My interests extend beyond coding; I enjoy collaborating with others on open-source projects and contributing to the developer community. I also have a strong interest in AI and machine learning, exploring how these technologies can be integrated into web applications for enhanced functionality.

Here are some of the pinned repositories that showcase my work:

- [Project One](https://github.com/evafridriks528/project-one): A full-stack web application built with React and Node.js.
- [Project Two](https://github.com/evafridriks528/project-two): A Python-based data analysis tool that visualizes complex datasets.
- [Project Three](https://github.com/evafridriks528/project-three): An open-source library for simplifying HTTP requests in JavaScript.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to collaborate on any projects or have any questions!
